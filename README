Object:
Stack velocities from different events for the same station, and calculate the average velocity. 

1)On the GORDON sever /oasis/scratch/yuanliu/temp_project/eastern_us
extract dynamical and structural velocity files from each event, stack them together for slowness
usage: ./get_all_slowness.sh

2)Download slowness_all folder to local directory(/Users/yuanyuanliu/Documents/wg_method/eastern_US/velo_stacking)
find the average slowness than average velocity, finally plot the velocity maps
usage: ./get_final_average.sh

There are several steps inside:
1]using python script to find average slowness, remove 'nan' results 
2]find the stations' latitude and longitude, then transfer slowness to velocity
3]plot the average velocity distribution maps
